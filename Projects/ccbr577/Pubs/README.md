*Lense Epithelium-Derived Growth Factor (LEDGF) fusion proteins redirect HVI-1 DNA integration*

HIV-1 binds to LEDGF, which in turn binds to chromatin. This relationship normally results in preferential integration of HIV-1 into expressed genes. Switching out the N terminus of LEDGF with chromatin binding domains from other proteins changes where HIV-1 integrates.

By switching this out for the PHD finger from ING2, which binds H3K4me3 -- associated with transcriptional start sites, LEDGF was shown to facilitate the integration of HIV-1 to the the transcription sites of expressed genes. They also tried this with HP1α and saw similar redirection of HIV-1 integration.

*H3K4me3 interactions with TAF3 regulate preinitiation complex assembly and selective gene activation*

This paper discusses more about H3K4me3 and how this histone mark is associated with gene activation.

*Specific HIV integration sites are linked to clonal expansion and persistence of infected cells*

Not only are some integration sites _much_ more common in some genes than others (in-vivo), but they have the same orientation as the gene in which they occur. This seems to stem from the fact that certain integration sites are associated with increased likelihood of clonal expansion of the infected cell.

A relevant bit of text from the discussion of this paper:
> Our results strongly imply that in at least some cases, sites of HIV integration play an important role in the expansion and persistence of infected cells in patients. This conclusion is particularly strong for the integrations into specific introns of the _MKL2_ and _BACH2_ genes. The integrations in _MKL2_ and _BACH2_ that were linked to clonal expansion were in internal introns, and in the same transcriptional orientation as the genes in which they are inserted. Even setting aside the fact that that it is extremely unlikely that such a large fraction of the integrations would have occurred in these two small segments of the genome, the probability that all 33 of the integrations we saw in _BACH2_ and _MKL2_ in the patients (table S4) would have been in the same orientation as the genes is ~10e−10.

*The integrator complex controls the termination of transcription at diverse calsses of gene targets*

Use of HITseq to identify function of _INTS3_, _NABP1_ and _NABP2_. Will want to look over this one more carfully, particularly Figures 1A, 2A, 3A and 3B, as well as how they are used to reach the conclusion.
