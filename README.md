# CCBR-Commons
This is a place for all CCBR analysts to share code associated with specific projects and also generally useful scripts with others in the CCBR.

Please ensure that some minimal amount of documentation is provided in the header of your script. For those that would like to provide addtional information, add a git markdown (see https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) or html file to the gh-pages branch, which will be displayed at http://ccbr.github.io/CCBR-Commons (also see [Randy's Git tutorial](https://github.com/CCBR/CCBR-Commons/blob/master/git.md)).

The following directories are currently in use:
* Exome - Scripts for QC, Analysis and Figures
* Microarray - Scripts for QC, Analysis and Figures
* Other - Miscelaneous scripts that don't quite fit elsewhere
* Projects - shared code for specific projects. Each project has a directory associated with the project number (e.g. ccbr563). A directory called Hlinks is also provided, where a human readable symbolic link can be created, pointing to the corresponding project folder (e.g. KSHV -> ../ccbr563).
* RNAseq - Scripts for QC, Analysis and Figures
